This is the SuperH QEMU staging and development patch tree.

The main purpose of this patch tree is to serve as a centralized point
where in-progress patches can be gathered and maintained, with the intent
that everything contained herein is aimed at the upstream QEMU tree with
a realistic expectation of being merged. Patches are added as they become
available, and dropped once they have been merged.

Why do this as a quilt tree?

The main goal is to archive and keep track of patches to help people
working in this area to avoid duplicated effort, to help users get at the
latest and greatest set of features, and to serve as a general overview
of what is available in the development stages.

Given that all development is intended to happen on the QEMU development
tree directly, forking the source base would not be beneficial. As the
patches contained herein are likewise not intended to hang around for the
long-haul, tracking them in tree form would lead to either frequent
rebases or a constantly growing pile of useless metadata from merge
points with the QEMU development tree.

This is not a fork, only an aid.

QEMU/SH updates and general information should be aimed at the LinuxSH
wiki QEMU page: http://www.linux-sh.org/shwiki/QEMU

Using the tree:

The patch tree first needs to be checked out for application:

	$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/qemu/lethal/qemu-sh.git

And then applied to the development tree:

	$ cd <qemu svn tree>
	$ QUILT_PATCHES=<path to cloned qemu-sh> quilt push -a

All other development proceeds as normal.

While quilt ships by default in pretty much every distribution available,
its home page can be found here: http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt

For all other quilt-related issues consult the quilt(1) man page.
